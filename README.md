# Filesystem MCP Server (MOD)

This is a fork from https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem
New feature: the server now works with the current project folder by default, and all other paths can be relative to the project root. This change facilitates to have the MCP server as global instead of local for each project.

Mind that this was a very quick and dirty patch for personal use, results may vary.
